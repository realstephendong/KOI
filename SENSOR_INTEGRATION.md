## üìä **Technical Implementation Details**

### **Sensor Manager Class Structure**
```python
class SensorManager:
    def __init__(self):
        # Your original GY521 configuration
        self.TILT_THRESHOLD = 70.0
        self.TILT_UPPER_BOUND = 180.0
        self.DRINKING_TIMEOUT = 2.0
        self.MIN_DRINKING_TIME = 0.3
        self.CALIBRATION_SAMPLES = 200
        self.NOISE_THRESHOLD = 5.0
        
        # Your water calculation constants
        self.BASE_FLOW_RATE = 0.5
        self.ANGLE_MULTIPLIER = 0.3
        self.MAX_FLOW_RATE = 8.0
        
        # Game integration variables
        self.water_amount = 0
        self.is_shaking = False
        self.shake_timer = 0
```

### **Drinking Detection Algorithm**
```python
def detect_drinking(self, current_time):
    # Your sophisticated orientation-independent tilt calculation
    current_vector = [self.accel_x + self.calibrated_x, ...]
    upright_vector = self.upright_vector
    dot = sum(a*b for a, b in zip(current_vector, upright_vector))
    total_tilt = math.degrees(math.acos(cos_angle))
    
    # Your noise filtering and stable reading requirements
    if (self.TILT_THRESHOLD < total_tilt < self.TILT_UPPER_BOUND) and 
       self.stable_readings >= self.required_stable_readings:
        # Calculate water consumption using your algorithm
        water_consumed = self.calculate_water_consumption(total_tilt, time_elapsed)
        self.water_amount = int(water_consumed)  # Game integration
        return True
```

### **Water Calculation Algorithm**
```python
def calculate_water_consumption(self, tilt_angle, time_elapsed):
    # Your improved flow rate calculation
    angle_factor = max(0, (tilt_angle - self.TILT_THRESHOLD) / 10.0)
    flow_rate = self.BASE_FLOW_RATE * (1 + angle_factor * self.ANGLE_MULTIPLIER)
    flow_rate = max(0, min(flow_rate, self.MAX_FLOW_RATE))
    
    water_consumed = flow_rate * time_elapsed
    if water_consumed > 5.0:  # Your safety check
        water_consumed = 5.0
    
    return water_consumed
```
